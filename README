* Download source yocto BSP

    $ git clone https://gitlab.com/embedded-yocto/udoo-neo-bsp.git -b morty
    
* Prepare the build environment

    To form a warm and cosy build environment you have to decide which board to start with.

    For UDOO Neo development 

    $ MACHINE=udooneo DISTRO=fslc-framebuffer source setup-environment build

* Build the Qt5 image

    $ bitbake udoo-image-qt5
    
* Burning the image to the SD-Card

    Please double check the device of your SD-Card. This can corrupt your installation

    I do the following on my Linux box

    $ umount /dev/sd<disk>?
    $ bzcat build/tmp/deploy/images/udooneo/udoo-image-qt5-udooneo.wic.bz2 | sudo dd of=/dev/<disk> bs=32M

* Cross compile a Qt5 SDK to use in QtCreator (no need to do this step)

    The recommended way to build a fully featured toolchain for your image is to use the populate_sdk target for building a toolchain installer

    $ bitbake udoo-image-qt5 -c populate_sdk
