    The FSL Community BSP is a community driven project to provide and maintain a Board Support Package meta layer to be used with OpenEmbedded-Core and Poky.

    It is composed by three main layers:

    meta-freescale: provides the base BSP support and the board support for Freescale i.MX and QorIQ reference boards;
    meta-freescale-3rdparty: provides support for 3rd party and partner boards;
    meta-freescale-distro: provides images recipes, demo recipes, and packagegroups used to ease the development with Yocto Project.
